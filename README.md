# PhysioTracker

**PhysioTracker** is an application developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), specifically designed for **physiotherapists** looking for advanced digital tools for clinical assessment and patient monitoring.

The project includes four main utilities:

- **Balance Assessment**: measures and analyses postural stability using dynamic data.
- **Strength and Fatigue**: evaluates applied force and analyses fatigue through force-time curve interpretation.
- **Range of Motion**: accurately measures joint mobility using motion tracking.
- **Body Chart Colour Analysis**: a visual tool to mark and analyse pain or dysfunction areas on a body chart.

PhysioTracker is intended to facilitate the collection of objective data, enhance patient progress tracking, and support clinical decision-making.
